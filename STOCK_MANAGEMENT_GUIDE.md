# Stock Management System - Complete Guide

## ✅ Problem Fixed: Stock Reduction When Orders are Placed

### Overview
The stock management system now automatically reduces product inventory when:
1. ✅ Orders are completed during checkout
2. ✅ Validates stock availability before allowing cart additions
3. ✅ Prevents users from ordering more than available stock
4. ✅ Shows real-time stock levels on product cards
5. ✅ Updates product database (both backend and localStorage)

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Product Service** (`src/app/services/product.ts`)

Added two new methods for stock management:

#### `updateStock(productId, quantityChange)`
- Updates stock for a single product
- Can increase (+) or decrease (-) stock
- Validates that stock doesn't go negative
- Syncs with backend and localStorage

#### `reduceStockForOrder(items[])`
- Reduces stock for multiple products at once
- Used when an order is placed
- Validates all items have sufficient stock
- Updates backend via API calls
- Falls back to localStorage if backend unavailable
- Logs detailed stock changes for each product

**Example logging:**
```
📦 Reducing stock for order items: [...]
✅ Reduced stock for Grey Goose Vodka: 35 → 34
✅ All stock updates saved to backend
```

---

### 2. **Checkout Component** (`src/app/components/checkout/checkout.ts`)

Enhanced the `placeOrder()` method to:
1. ✅ Reduce stock BEFORE saving the order
2. ✅ Only save order if stock reduction is successful
3. ✅ Show error if items are out of stock
4. ✅ Maintain data integrity

**Order Flow:**
```
User clicks "Place Order"
    ↓
Validate forms
    ↓
Reduce stock for all cart items ← NEW!
    ↓
Save order to database
    ↓
Clear cart
    ↓
Show success message
```

---

### 3. **Cart Component** (`src/app/components/cart/cart.ts`)

Enhanced `updateQuantity()` method to:
- ✅ Validate quantity against available stock
- ✅ Show alert if user tries to exceed stock
- ✅ Automatically limit to maximum available stock
- ✅ Prevent overselling

**Example:**
```
User has 2 items in cart
Product has only 3 in stock
User tries to change quantity to 5
→ Alert: "Only 3 items available in stock for [Product Name]"
→ Quantity automatically set to 3
```

---

### 4. **Customer Products Component** (`src/app/components/customer-products/customer-products.ts`)

Enhanced `addToCart()` method to:
- ✅ Check current cart quantity before adding
- ✅ Prevent adding if it would exceed stock
- ✅ Show clear error messages
- ✅ Display stock levels on product cards

**Features:**
- Shows "X in stock" badge on each product
- Shows "Out of Stock" for unavailable items
- Disables "Add to Cart" button when stock = 0
- Validates against current cart items

---

## 🎯 How Stock Management Works

### Scenario 1: Adding Products to Cart
```
Product: Grey Goose Vodka
Current Stock: 10
Current in Cart: 0

User clicks "Add to Cart"
✅ Added to cart (Cart: 1)

User clicks "Add to Cart" again (9 times)
✅ Added to cart (Cart: 10)

User clicks "Add to Cart" again
❌ Alert: "Cannot add more. Only 10 items available"
```

### Scenario 2: Completing an Order
```
Cart Items:
- Grey Goose Vodka: 2 units (Stock: 35)
- Hennessy Cognac: 1 unit (Stock: 40)

User completes checkout
↓
📦 Reducing stock for order items...
✅ Grey Goose Vodka: 35 → 33
✅ Hennessy Cognac: 40 → 39
✅ Order saved
✅ Cart cleared

Updated Database:
- Grey Goose Vodka: 33 in stock
- Hennessy Cognac: 39 in stock
```

### Scenario 3: Insufficient Stock
```
Product: Rare Whiskey (Stock: 1)
User A has 1 in cart
User B tries to add to cart

User A completes order
✅ Stock: 1 → 0

User B tries to checkout
❌ "Some items may be out of stock. Please check your cart"
```

## 🧪 Testing Stock Management

### Test 1: Basic Stock Reduction
1. **Check initial stock**:
   - Login as admin
   - Note stock levels for a product (e.g., "Grey Goose Vodka: 35")

2. **Place an order**:
   - Login as customer
   - Add 2 units of Grey Goose Vodka to cart
   - Complete checkout with all details
   - Submit order

3. **Verify stock reduced**:
   - Login as admin again
   - Check Grey Goose Vodka stock
   - Should now show: 33 (35 - 2 = 33)

4. **Verify in files**:
   ```bash
   # Check orders.json - order should be saved
   cat src/assets/orders.json
   
   # Check products.json - stock should be updated
   cat src/assets/products.json | grep -A 5 "Grey Goose"
   ```

### Test 2: Stock Validation in Cart
1. Add product with limited stock (e.g., 3 units available)
2. In cart, try to change quantity to 5
3. Should see alert: "Only 3 items available"
4. Quantity should be limited to 3

### Test 3: Out of Stock Prevention
1. Find product with 1 item in stock
2. Add to cart
3. Try to add again
4. Should see: "Cannot add more. Only 1 items available"

### Test 4: Multiple Products Order
1. Add multiple different products to cart
2. Complete checkout
3. Check that ALL products have reduced stock

### Test 5: Checkout Stock Validation
1. Add product to cart (stock: 5, quantity: 2)
2. **Without completing order**, manually reduce stock in admin to 1
3. Try to complete checkout
4. Should show error about insufficient stock

## 🔍 Monitoring Stock Changes

### Browser Console Logs
When placing an order, you'll see detailed logs:

```
📦 Processing order and reducing stock...
📦 Reducing stock for order items: [{productId: 2, quantity: 2}, ...]
✅ Reduced stock for Grey Goose Vodka: 35 → 33
✅ Reduced stock for Hennessy Cognac: 40 → 39
✅ All stock updates saved to backend
✅ Stock reduced successfully
📦 Attempting to save order: {...}
✅ Order saved to backend successfully!
✅ Order saved successfully: {...}
```

### Server Console Logs
The backend shows:
```
PUT /api/products/2
✅ Product updated: Grey Goose Vodka
✅ Data written to /path/to/products.json

POST /api/orders
📦 Received order request: {...}
✅ Order saved successfully: {...}
```

## 📊 Database Updates

### products.json
Before order:
```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Grey Goose Vodka",
  "stock": 35,
  ...
}
```

After order (2 units):
```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Grey Goose Vodka",
  "stock": 33,
  ...
}
```

### orders.json
New order added with items purchased:
```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "userId": 3,
  "items": [
    {
      "product": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Grey Goose Vodka",
        ...
      },
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ],
  "total": 87.98,
  ...
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Backend Required
For stock to persist across sessions, the backend server MUST be running:

```bash
cd /Users/vinvivek/Angular-Task/sipstop
node server.js
```

### Fallback Behavior
If backend is unavailable:
- ✅ Stock updates save to localStorage
- ✅ Changes persist in current browser session
- ❌ Changes won't persist across different browsers/devices
- ❌ Changes lost when localStorage is cleared

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Stock Not Reducing
1. **Check server is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```

2. **Check browser console** for errors:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for red errors
   - Check for stock update logs

3. **Check server console** for API calls:
   - Should see PUT requests to `/api/products/:id`
   - Should see product update confirmations

4. **Verify products.json** is writable:
   ```bash
   ls -la src/assets/products.json
   ```

### Stock Shows Incorrect Values
1. **Reload products**: Admin dashboard → refresh page
2. **Check localStorage**: Clear browser cache
3. **Verify backend data**:
   ```bash
   cat src/assets/products.json
   ```

### Error: "Some items may be out of stock"
1. Check if product stock is sufficient
2. Another user may have purchased the item
3. Refresh the product list
4. Remove and re-add items to cart

## 🎨 UI Indicators

### Product Card Stock Badges
- **Green badge**: "X in stock" (stock > 0)
- **Red badge**: "Out of Stock" (stock = 0)
- **Disabled button**: "Unavailable" (stock = 0)

### Admin Dashboard
- **Low stock warning**: Orange badge when stock < 20
- **Normal stock**: Green badge when stock ≥ 20
